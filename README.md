# 🎯 Bandit Algorithms – Learning & Applications

This repository documents my journey to master **multi-armed bandit algorithms** and their applications, based on the book:

> **Bandit Algorithms** – Tor Lattimore & Csaba Szepesvári  
> [Book PDF](https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf)

I summarize each chapter in a **Jupyter notebook** with:
- 📚 **Key theory** explained in my own words
- ✏️ **Mathematical derivations** written with LaTeX
- 💻 **From-scratch implementations** in Python
- 📊 **Visualizations** to understand algorithm behavior
- 🌍 **Real-world inspired applications** (dynamic pricing, recommendation systems, ad optimization, A/B testing, etc.)
